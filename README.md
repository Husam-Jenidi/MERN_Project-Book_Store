MERN Project-1

This is MERN Stack application where I built a simple book store website, where a list of books stored on a mongo Database.
You can view the books, edit them, delete them and add a new book.
Also there is dark mode implementation.
The backend server is done by express and the communication with the database is done by mongoos
The front is React with tailwindCSS in adition to using react-icons
